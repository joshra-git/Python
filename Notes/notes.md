# General notes

You can do the int() float() within your block rather than setting it within a variable

---


### committing changes
git commit -m "pushing" -a = this will push everything through


### pushing to main / branch
git push origin main = this will push those changes to the repo


### for loops

I don't need to set a variable for a for loop
for jump in range(6):
    jumps()

vs. 

jumping = range(6)
for jump in jumping:
    jumps()
