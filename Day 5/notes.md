len() - the length of the list 
sum() - adds everything up
max() - shows the highest value in a list
min() - shows the lowest value in a list
range() - 

number % 3 = 0


I could have also used random.choice(numbers) in my password generator, this would have been better for doing it rather than my way. It still works but less code

I would then have to go --

for char in range(1, nr_symbols + 1) rather than -1
